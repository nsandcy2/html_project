    <h1><u>Solar System</u></h1>
    <p>The Solar System is a fascinating place, filled with diverse celestial bodies. Let's explore some of its wonders:
    </p>
    <h2><b>Solar System Overview</b></h2>
    <p>The Solar System consists of the Sun and the celestial objects that are bound to it by its gravity, including
        eight planets and their moons, dwarf planets, comets, and other space debris. It is located in the Milky Way
        galaxy and is part of the larger universe.</p>
    <p><b>Motion:</b> The Solar System orbits around the center of the Milky Way galaxy, moving at an average speed of
        about 828,000 km/h. Each planet also orbits the Sun in elliptical paths, following Kepler's laws of planetary
        motion.</p>
    <p><b>Presence:</b> The Solar System occupies a vast region of space, spanning approximately 4.6 billion kilometers
        from the Sun to the outermost reaches of its influence. It provides the necessary conditions for life on Earth
        and serves as a subject of scientific exploration and discovery.</p>

        <h2>Inner Solar System</h2>
        <p>The inner Solar System comprises the terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt. These planets are
            relatively
            close to the Sun and have rocky compositions.</p>
        <h3>Terrestrial Planets</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mercury:</strong> The smallest planet in the Solar System, with a surface covered in rupes
                and
                bright ray systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Venus:</strong> The hottest planet, with a reflective atmosphere mainly composed of carbon
                dioxide.</li>
            <li><strong>Earth:</strong> The only planet known to support life, with a complex climate and weather
                system.</li>
            <li><strong>Mars:</strong> Known for its red surface, polar ice caps, and evidence of past volcanic
                activity.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Asteroid Belt</h3>
        <p>The asteroid belt is located between Mars and Jupiter, containing remnants from the Solar System's
            formation.
            The largest object in the belt is Ceres, the only dwarf planet in this region.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Outer Solar System</h2>
        <p>The outer region of the Solar System is home to the giant planets, their moons, and other objects
            like
            centaurs and short-period comets.</p>
        <h3>Giant Planets</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Jupiter:</strong> The largest planet, known for its colorful bands and the Great Red
                Spot.</li>
            <li><strong>Saturn:</strong> Famous for its extensive ring system made of ice particles and rocky
                debris.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Uranus:</strong> An ice giant with a tilted rotational axis, giving it unique seasonal
                variations.</li>
            <li><strong>Neptune:</strong> The farthest planet from the Sun, with the strongest winds in the
                Solar
                System.</li>
            <li><strong><mark>Pluto: </mark></strong> The farthest planet from the Sun,but In August 2006 the
                International Astronomical Union (IAU) downgraded the status of Pluto to that of “dwarf planet.”
